### How to Run the Application

1. Clone the project from GitHub:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/samueldeotti/maispraTi.git
    ```
   or
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:samueldeotti/maispraTi.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd maispraTi
    cd atv5
    cd multi-app
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

5. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

6. Wait for a new tab to open in your browser, or open it manually. The application usually runs on port 5173, but it may open on a different port. If you encounter issues, check the terminal for the specified port.
    ```bash
    http://localhost:5173/
    ```
